NHS WP Jobs Shortcode Plugin

before use:
'npm i && npm run build' from the plugin folder

example usage of the shortcode url defaults to the one in example:
[nhsjobfeed url=https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/search_xml?keyword=nursing%20associate&field=title]

make sure you have this style included so it hides the employers that dont match your search
.nhsuk-checkboxes__item.hidden {
  display: none;
}
